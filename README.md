Thanks to [@samunders-core](https://github.com/samunders-core) for [this implementation](https://gist.github.com/samunders-core/1acaadc064f203e4f2ab769c7dfabeda) of the unmangling algorithm.

See the [Whiptools wiki](https://github.com/ninjatobob/Whiptools/wiki) for further information on file formats and current limitations.
